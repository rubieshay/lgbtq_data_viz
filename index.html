            <blockquote id="quote-1-1" class="quote-active">When I came out I was 29 (it was 1985). My father had just died in an accident and that forced me to confront being gay and moving forward to live my true life. I knew I was gay when I was 13, but repressed it through HS, college, and my 20&#8217;s. I didn&#8217;t date women. I was just a solo person, with many friends, who stayed busy with other activities. I&#8217;m 66 now, married to a long-time partner. I envy the youth of today. I still sometimes struggle when I recall the pain of hiding from everyone including myself for so many years. (M/66/Gay)</blockquote>
            <blockquote id="quote-1-2">When I came out, it was really tough and heartbreaking. My mom was silent during the time while my dad called me an imaginative freak because he believes that asexuality is imaginary and not real. I was sad and depressed after that and the second I moved out at 18, which was in May, I felt free. I attended my first Pride Parade three months ago. (M/18/Asexual)</blockquote>

I wrote my mom a letter, explaining that I like girls, and when she finished reading it, she hugged me. Then she said &#8220;Honey, this is how you were born, and I love you for it.&#8221; I know not everybody has an easy time, but her reaction helped me to come out to the rest of my family. (F/17/Lesbian)</blockquote>
            <blockquote id="quote-2-2">When I came out, I was sitting on the porch swing with my older sister as we shared stories from our day. I hesitated with a knot in my stomach for a while before finally summoning the courage to say, &#8220;I need to tell you something. You know {my friend&#8217;s name}? Well, we are dating. I&#8217;m gay.&#8221; My sister turned to me with a big smile. She wrapped her arm around my shoulder, pulling me close as she whispered, &#8220;Thank you for being you.&#8221; I&#8217;ll never forget that. (M/17/Gay)

            <blockquote id="quote-3-1" class="quote-active">When I came out, me and my older cousin, who was also closeted, decided to come out at the same time. We went to the family room and I told my family that I was pansexual and they accepted me. My cousin, on the other hand, was faced with discrimination and disgust, for they came out as non-binary. My family erupted in an argument and after a few weeks, my older cousin came to live with us. Now, me and my cousin spend every single day together and enjoy each other&#8217;s company.

            <blockquote id="quote-3-2">When I came out, I was teased and even abused. My father was a conservative and he worked for our town mayor and he was never fond of the LGBTQ+ community. And ever since my mom passed away, my father only got worse and started drinking. I mustered up the courage to tell that I liked both boys and girls. He shot me this dirty look and called me names before dragging my hair and throwing me into my room. When I came out to my school, which was a Christian school, everyone laughed and made fun of me. But, I will find acceptance and I won&#8217;t let people bring me down. (F/16/Bisexual)</blockquote>

            <blockquote id="quote-4-1" class="quote-active">When I came out, I was 14. I felt very uncomfortable in my own skin and I would sort of shame myself, as an example, I would pull my hair and cut it. And when I came into my parent&#8217;s bedroom, they looked at me and just sighed. I don&#8217;t know in relief or in shame, but they looked at me and nodded slightly. I took it as acceptance and now I&#8217;m living as my true self. (Transgender man [FtM]/19/Demiromantic)</blockquote>
            <blockquote id="quote-4-2">When I came out to my parents, it made me realize a lot. I didn&#8217;t get the choice to come out on my own terms, as they found out on their own and I was forced to come out. I felt pretty heartbroken when they responded with disgust and disbelief, almost like it was phenomenon. After that they just ignored who I was and it was just pretty awkward after that. I wish it ended up differently but it made realize that I should accept myself because that&#8217;s who I am. Do not let people dictate on who you are. Be yourself.
