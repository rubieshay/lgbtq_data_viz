                <p>I, like many, grew up not knowing I was queer till I was an adult. I grew up in an unaccepting environment where LGBT anything was shunned and I internalized some of that. I’m really glad that today’s youth get at least a bit more acceptance and I hope that tomorrow’s youth will get even more. I hope that someday, being LGBT is so normalized that coming out won’t even be a thing. That someday straight and cis will no longer be assumed to be “the default” with LGBT being “the other”.</p>

                <p>I was biking to school one morning and I had [a pride pin] on my backpack. I was taking the route I usually took and I didn’t really think I was in that much danger. But some truck was behind me and I kid you not he SWERVED INTO THE BIKE LANE TO TRY AND HIT ME. I was able to pull my bike onto the sidewalk in time and he just drove off and screamed “QUEER!” really angrily out the window. [...] This really shook me up, not just in the fact that I had almost died but because I grew up in such a sheltered community with such supportive friends and family, I kind of forgot that people would do this kind of shit. Anyways I took the pin off, I just haven’t really felt that safe ever since that incident.</p>
